# SalesDashboard

Skills Shown: Power BI, SQL Server.  Views, Subqueries, Joins, Agg Functions, GroupBy, Window Functions, Direct Query, Visualization.

In this project, I create a Dashboard connecting to SQL Database: Adventure Works 2019 (SQL Server) from POWER BI through Direct Query.

The main idea, is to analyze the sales distributed per Product and Territory for a given year, so in order to do so I created the View called ProductsSales_by_Territory.

Also, I created another two queries from ProductsSales_by_Territory views in order to analyze:
Profitability for each product (margin). To identify the most/less Profitable Products.
Best Selling Product by Territory Group.

You can find the queries (three) use in this project in "Sales_Dashboard. SQL Queries"
